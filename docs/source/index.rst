ZeusAI.py Docs
==============

ZeusAI.py is the official python wrapper for ZeusAI's client and plugin APIs,
designed to make plugin and client development easy using python.

ZeusAI.py is designed to work on any platform, however the ZeusAI server only
supports Linux-based operating systems, so plugins should be developed with linux in mind.
Clients can run on any operating system.
